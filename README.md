Steps to run code:
make
./a.out

Follow the prompts to simulate the Game. If you are prompted to provide a file,
I have included two different files to run the simulation. One is a simple
glider ("glider.txt") that will continuously run in doughnut mode. The other
one is a glider gunner ("gg.txt") that will go back and forth through the
simulation.
